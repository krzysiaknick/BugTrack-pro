## BugTrackPro
BugTrackPro is a website deployed on Azure that uses React and Next.js.
This site is intended to inform the user of numerous ways to debug their code in a React environment

## BugTrackPro Azure Site: https://yellow-river-0df0a7b10.4.azurestaticapps.net/

This site was created based on my class project proposal found at https://victorious-grass-0439aed10.4.azurestaticapps.net/
The nature of this final project was a little different than most as it was intended as a research project rather than an implementation of technical features. 
despite this, I believe I showed my technical knowledge by creating a visually appealing React site to display the information I found during my research. I was able to complete all that I proposed.
